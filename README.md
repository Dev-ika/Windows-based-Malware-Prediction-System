deep-learning-techniques/


• Developed a model which accurately predicts the probability that Windows
operating system will be hit by a malware based on the operating system
variables from Microsoft dataset.
• Time split validation, feature encoding, and elimination of features by
variable importance techniques were used to extract new useful variables
from given problem dataset before analysing them.
